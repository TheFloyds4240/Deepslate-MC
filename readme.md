DeepslateMC is a server solution designed to allow for easy cross play between Java and Bedrock Servers
While GeyserMC Does Exist, and is a wonderful program, it can sometimes be a pain to set up.
So, we have fixed that by creating a script that will automatically setup Geyser and will automatically update your server software as well.
We use both GeyserMC and Purpur in out project.
